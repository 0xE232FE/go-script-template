# OGame Ninja - go script template

This repo contains all the definitions of functions/constants/variables/structs that can be in a ogame ninja script.  
Allowing you to use your favorite editor/IDE and enjoy smart autocompletion.

For some examples of scripts using the go vm, refer to -> https://github.com/ogame-ninja/scripts/tree/master/official/go_vm

- Download this repository
- Work in your favorite environment VSCode/Goland IDE on the `main.go` file
- Enjoy all the niceties of "go to definition" and "autocompletion"
- When the script is ready, create a new script in ogame ninja with the extension `.gox` (go experimental) eg: `my_script.gox`

Warning:  
The go script VM is far from being stable.  
It is easy to produce code that would crash the VM for no reason.  
Errors might be cryptic and hard to debug.  
That being said, it will not affect the overall application.
